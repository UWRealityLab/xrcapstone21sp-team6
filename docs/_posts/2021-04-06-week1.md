# Code Updates

Our capstone team’s website is up. We used GitHub pages and a template. This website is where we will keep our bio, weekly blog posts, updates, and project info.

# Update on Ideas

Our team is working on a VR application for the Oculus Quest 2. We brainstormed many ideas and have ultimately landed on an immersive storytelling experience. This experience will allow users to choose their outcome, it will incorporate gamification elements, and it will tell an exciting story. We plan to create a sci-fi world for our story.


# Plan for Next Week

We will create a project proposal and begin planning the steps to create a quality final project. We plan to start writing our story and designing our world. We will also be working on a project pitch and creating a project requirements document.
