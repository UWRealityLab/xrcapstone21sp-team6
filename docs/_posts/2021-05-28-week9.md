# Each Member's Progress

**Sarah Rashid**

Made PR video, created title screen and controls, added and edited voice overs, fixed bugs for rock samples.

**Ramya Ravichandran Asha**

Moved the retroreflector, drilling interaction and Aayush’s tools info panels so that it is the last stop in the rock sampling mission. Added voice-over and fixed some bugs.

**Aayush Chhabra**

Worked on rearranging the scene for our final product.

**Peter Lin**

Worked on integrating the rover with Sarah and Ramya’s missions. Worked on rover’s voice-over. Fixed a lot of bugs. Changed to hide museum objects during missions.

# Code Updates
All the components that make up the Apollo 15 experience have been put together in a cohesive manner. We have incorporated a title screen with a diagram to help the user understand how to use the controllers in the experience, added more voice overs, improved LRV features and made the second mission flow better, and more. Voila, Apollo 15 VR mission complete!
