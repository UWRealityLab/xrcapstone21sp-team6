# Each Member's Progress

**Sarah Rashid**

Adding second part of mission 2, voice overs, control screen, working on bugs and improving rock sample experience.

**Ramya Ravichandran Asha**

Continued working on deep drill core sample UI panel and drilling interaction.

**Aayush Chhabra**

Completed the gravity experience, built the Galileo Experiment, added video assets for the experiment, and created an information panel for different tools.

All the parts are moved into the master and placed in the scene.

**Peter Lin**

Worked on the mission integration. The rover can now bring the user to different mission locations. Also added audio guidance along the way.

# Code Updates
All of our components that make the Apollo 15 experience what it is are almost ready! We are mostly working on getting everything cohesive and together and squashing bugs. We have incorporated a drilling interaction to finish off our rock sample mission, a feather and hammer gravity simulation for the museum, new voice overs, improved LRV features, and more.
