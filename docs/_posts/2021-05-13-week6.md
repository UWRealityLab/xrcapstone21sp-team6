# Each Member's Progress

**Sarah Rashid**
Implement the collecting lunar sample mission.
* Implement information panel. We present realistic historical image that matches our lunar scene.
* Add rock asset and grabing interaction.

**Ramya Ravichandran Asha**

Created an interactive visualization of the Laser Ranging Retroreflector experiment (deployed during Apollo 11, 14 and 15). Clicking on the locations of the observatory on Earth or the retroreflector on the moon brings up a different information panel.

Tried using Don McCurdy’s aframe-inspector-plugin-recast but was unable to create a nav mesh (the lunar terrain might be too large and complex to create one with this tool).

**Aayush Chhabra**

* Worked on Information Panels for the different tools. (info branch)
* Experimented with different gravity for different entities for the museum experience. (gravity branch)
* Created a low fidelity model for the drill (drill branch)
* Shifted the project to GitLab. (We have ran out of Glitch memory)
  * Branch drill: contains model for the drill which can be incorporated in the master later.
  * Branch gravity: contains experiments done for gravity on different boxes. Still experimenting with CANNON.js and Ammo.js to figure out the possibilities for an immersive experience.
  * Branch info: contains an info panel. Click on different tools and get information/assets for those tools.

Links to all the branches are included in the links section.

**Peter Lin**

Implemented the Lunar Rover experience. Tasks include:
* Purchase model, model processing in blender, import model
* Onboard vehicle experience. A sign for clicking any button to onboard will show up as the user come close to the vehicle
* Driving vehicle experience. Users can drive the car through the joystick. Lots of JavaScript coding.

# Code Updates

Our project has been moved from Glitch to Gitlab as we ran out of space for assets on Glitch.

Note: For gitlab links, checkout the respective branch and experiment with that branch to see the different changes. Some branches contain new files with experimental features in development.

# Update on Ideas

We had a discussion with John last Sunday regarding our plans for mission 2. In this mission, we are planning to have the user drive the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) to different locations to collect rock samples/cores and conduct experiments. For example, we are planning to include a drilling interaction in order to obtain a core, collect the Genesis rock (a famous sample that is about 4 billion years old), and visualize experiments like the Laser Ranging Retroreflector experiment. 

# Plan for Next Week

We plan to incorporate all of our work which is currently in separate branches together in a cohesive manner. For example, we are planning to include a map in the LRV which the user could look at in order to drive the LRV to the different rock sampling and experimentation locations.

**Sarah**

Finish implementing the rest of the mission. Add Genesis rock too.


**Ramya Ravichandran Asha**

Create a map to be displayed on the LRV’s computer to aid the user with navigation.

**Aayush**

Continue to add more information panels.

**Peter**

More refinement to the lunar vehicle. Potentially adding a map guiding users to mission locations.

# Blocking Issues

Currently none.
